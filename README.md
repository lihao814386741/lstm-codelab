# lstm-codelab
Codelab for LSTM training

This codelab is mostly copied from Google's time series notebook.
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/time_series.ipynb#scrollTo=pOzaIRYBhqwg 

It uses Keras to train models based on the predefined LSTM.
